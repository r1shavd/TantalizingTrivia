# Tantalizing Trivia

A quiz application made using the python3 and is a GUI-based application. The application is a high school project in computer programming, so pardon me for the childish and dirty code. The application uses the tkinter module for the graphical objects (GUI windows), and also uses the sqlite3 module in order to access the database.sqlite file to store the in-app data.

## Note

* The application was meant to be submitted as a high school computer programming project, therefore the codes might be messy, more formally we can say that the codes are childish. Also there would be no further updates to the application, just one time upload is made for the backups.
* If you face any errors and can fix them, you can kindly pull a request for update or else send us the updated code at _rdofficial192@gmail.com_.
